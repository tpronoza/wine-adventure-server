      "description": "The 2018 7 DeadlyÂ® Red is a sinners delight. A deep ruby color with tempting aromas of cranberry, ripe cherry, leather and a whiff of BBQ smoke. The seduction continues with flavors of blackberry, smashed plum and notes of black pepper which lead to a lingering, jammy finish with a kiss of spice.",
